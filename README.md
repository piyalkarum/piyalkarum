- 👋   Hi, I’m Piyal Karunarathne [@piyalkarum]
- 👀   I’m interested in mechanisms that lead to speciation and diversification of species
- 🌱   I’m currently working on two main topics where I'm developing models and staticstical approaches to a) detect local adaptation in plant genomes using structural variants b) determine evolutionary origin of plant biomes
- 💞️   I’m looking to collaborate on model development in evolutionary biology and biogeography
