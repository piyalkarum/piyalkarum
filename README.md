- 👋🏾   Hi, I’m Piyal Karunarathne [@piyalkarum]
- 👀   I’m interested in mechanisms that lead to speciation and diversification of species
- 🌱   I’m currently working on three main topics where I'm developing models and statistical approaches to
-   a) study the effect of natural selection on copy number variation in plant gene families
-   b) detect local adaptation in plant genomes using structural variants
-   c) assess the determinants of the spatial distribution of genetic diversity

- 🙌🏾   I’m currently looking to collaborate on model development in evolutionary biology and biogeography
- 📫   Please reach me at: piyal.karunarathne@hhu.de; piyalkarumail@yahoo.com; or Twitter @kaint_w8_karu
